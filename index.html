                    <h2>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?</h2>
                    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for
                        display
                        on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images. Each
                        individual
                        piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though
                            many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display
                            effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p>

                    <h2>What is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</h2>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                        document
                        written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
                        elements
                        should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core
                        languages of
                        the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
                        Previously, the
                        development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
                        versioning
                        of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will
                        never
                        be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
