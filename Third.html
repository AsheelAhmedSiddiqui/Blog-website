                    <h2>What is React JS?</h2>
                    <p>React.js, more commonly known as React, is a free, open-source JavaScript library. It works best to build user interfaces by combining sections of code (components) into full websites. Originally built by Facebook, Meta and the open-source community now maintain it. One of the good things about React is that you can use it as much or as little as you want! For example, you can build your entire site in React or just use one single React component on one page.</p>

                    <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
                    <p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control.[10] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p>
